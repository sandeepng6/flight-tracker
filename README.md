## Development server
After unzipping navigate to flight-tracker folder
Go to flight-tracker folder from terminal and type the following command

The following command produces a QR code which can be used to preview the app on a device without the need to install various SDKs and tools or configure your environment for local iOS or Android development.

To scan the QR code and deploy your app on a device, you need to have the NativeScript Playground app:

App Store (iOS): https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/nativescript-playground/id1263543946?mt=8&ls=1
Google Play (Android): https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.nativescript.play
After scanning the QR code with the scanner provided in the NativeScript Playground app, your app will be launched on your device through the Preview app. Additionally, any changes made to your project will be automatically synchronized with the deployed app
